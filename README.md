# Sentiment Classification of IMDb Movie Reviews

**Authors:** Timothy Mok, Aron Saengchan, and Jimmy Zhu

## Summary
The focus of this project was to extend and improve upon the research conducted Pang et al. [1] on the sentiment classification of IMDb movies reviews. In order to improve upon the previous work, different methods in the natural language processing and machine learning algorithms were applied to IMDb movie review data in order to classify them into two distinct categories - positive or negative. The textual data used in this project involved a combination of the original dataset collected in the original study, as well as a newly acquired dataset from Kaggle [2].

A set of preprocessing techniques were selected and applied to data in order to prepare it for machine learning analysis. In addition to the best support vector classifier used in the previous study, a set of three new machine learning techniques were employed for this project - logistic regression, random forest classification, and gradient boosting classification. Each model underwent rigorous tuning and optimization in order to obtain the best outcome and the results were compared using various performance metrics to determine if the sentiment analysis was improved upon.
